//! A counting global allocator backing the peak-allocation oracle.
//!
//! Peak here means the high-water mark of live bytes (`allocated - freed`),
//! measured by the harness itself rather than reading system memory (O3).
//! [`CountingAllocator::open_window`] starts a fresh window: it returns the
//! live-byte baseline and resets the *window* peak, so
//! [`CountingAllocator::window_peak`] then tracks the high-water mark of
//! live bytes **within that window** — per input, not per process. The
//! process-global `peak` stays as a historical figure.
//!
//! Resetting the window is racy: an allocation straddling the reset may be
//! folded in just before it is overwritten and so missed. That is acceptable
//! for a budget guard — the fuzzer target thread is the only party that
//! matters, and the detached highlight worker's spillover is deliberately
//! tolerated via the 2.5x layout factor. The fuzzer runs single-threaded;
//! the background worker may still inflate a window slightly. That
//! conservatism is fine: the budget is a guard, not a measurement.
